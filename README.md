MidtermCode Reop
This repo is for the wdd3400 midterm question 3. The objective of the code was a website that provided a /home, /about page, and 404/500 error pages. After reviewing the code I saw that the widget for fortune telling and tab icon were not fleshed out. I installed favicon and used the fortune code from a previous assignment to complete their functionality.

Now when visiting the site the home page presents as expected including tab icon, the /about page presents as intended including a fortune, and 400 error page reported as expected.
